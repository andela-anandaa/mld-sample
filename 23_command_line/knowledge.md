### Quick Notes

#### Command Line Alias
In computing, alias is a command in various command line interpreters (shells) such as Unix shells, 4DOS/4NT and Windows PowerShell, which enables a replacement of a word by another string. It is mainly used for abbreviating a system command, or for adding default arguments to a regularly used command.

**How to create aliases**
e.g.
In my `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`, I add the following:
```
alias kubectl=kube
alias ggp='git push'
```
